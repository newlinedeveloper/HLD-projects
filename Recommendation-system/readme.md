### Design of an Online Recommendation System (e.g., Netflix or Amazon)

---

### **1. Key Components**

#### **User Profiling**
- Collect user data to create profiles, including explicit feedback (ratings, likes) and implicit behavior (views, searches).
- Profiles are updated in real-time to reflect user interactions.

#### **Content Recommendation**
- Uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend items.
- Employs hybrid models combining both methods for improved accuracy.

#### **Personalization**
- Tailored recommendations based on user profiles, preferences, and behavior.
- The system constantly evolves by learning from user interactions.

---

### **2. Algorithms**

#### **Collaborative Filtering**
- **User-Based**: Finds users with similar preferences and recommends items they liked.
- **Item-Based**: Recommends items similar to those the user has liked.
- **Matrix Factorization** (e.g., SVD): Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors.

#### **Content-Based Filtering**
- Uses item metadata and user interaction to recommend similar items.
- Techniques like **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** measure item similarity.

#### **Hybrid Methods**
- Combine collaborative and content-based approaches to leverage their strengths.

### **3. Back-of-the-Envelope Calculation**

- **Users**: 10 million users.
- **Items**: 1 million items.
- **Interactions**: 1 billion interactions.

- **Storage Requirements**:
  - User profile: 1KB each → 10 GB.
  - Item metadata: 1KB each → 1 GB.
  - Interaction log: 100 bytes each → 100 GB.

- **Read/Write Operations**:
  - 1 million reads/writes per second during peak hours.

### **4. Database Design**

#### **Tables**:
1. **Users**:
   - `user_id` (PK)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `preferences`

2. **Items**:
   - `item_id` (PK)
   - `title`
   - `description`
   - `metadata`

3. **User_Item_Interactions**:
   - `interaction_id` (PK)
   - `user_id` (FK)
   - `item_id` (FK)
   - `interaction_type` (view, like, rating)
   - `timestamp`

4. **Recommendations**:
   - `user_id` (PK)
   - `recommended_items` (List of item_ids)

#### **Database**:
- **Primary DB**: Relational database (PostgreSQL) for transactional operations.
- **NoSQL DB**: DynamoDB or MongoDB for storing large volumes of semi-structured data like logs.
- **Cache**: Redis or Memcached for quick access to frequently accessed data.

### **5. API Design**

#### **Endpoints**:

1. **Get User Profile**:
   - `GET /users/{user_id}`
   - Response: User details and preferences.

2. **Update User Profile**:
   - `PUT /users/{user_id}`
   - Body: Updated user information.
   - Response: Success message.

3. **Get Item Details**:
   - `GET /items/{item_id}`
   - Response: Item details and metadata.

4. **Log Interaction**:
   - `POST /interactions`
   - Body: User-item interaction details.
   - Response: Success message.

5. **Get Recommendations**:
   - `GET /recommendations/{user_id}`
   - Response: List of recommended items.

### **6. High-Level Architecture**

#### **1. Data Collection Layer**:
- Collects user interactions and stores them in the database.

#### **2. Data Processing Layer**:
- Uses frameworks like Apache Spark or AWS Glue for ETL.
- Prepares data for model training.

#### **3. Model Training Layer**:
- Utilizes machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Amazon SageMaker) for training models.

#### **4. Serving Layer**:
- Real-time API for serving recommendations.
- Uses AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and ElastiCache for caching.

#### **5. Storage Layer**:
- Relational and NoSQL databases for structured and unstructured data.
- S3 for storing logs and model artifacts.

#### **6. Monitoring and Logging**:
- AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging system performance.

### **7. Scalability and Fault Tolerance**

- **Scalability**: Uses distributed systems and cloud-based solutions like AWS to scale horizontally.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Replication and redundancy ensure minimal downtime.
