### Design of a Content Delivery Network (CDN)

---

### **1. Key Components**

#### **Caching**
- CDN edge servers cache content closer to end-users to reduce latency.
- Uses caching strategies like **Time-to-Live (TTL)**, **LRU (Least Recently Used)**, and **cache invalidation** policies.

#### **Routing**
- **DNS-based routing** to direct users to the nearest edge server.
- **Anycast routing** to ensure requests are routed to the optimal server based on latency.

#### **Content Replication**
- Replicates content across multiple geographically distributed edge servers.
- Uses **push** (content pushed from the origin to edge) or **pull** (edge server requests content from origin on demand) strategies.

#### **Latency Minimization**
- Content is served from the nearest edge server, reducing the round-trip time.
- **Compression** and **HTTP/2** further optimize data transfer.

#### **Handling Network Failures**
- **Failover mechanisms** ensure requests are rerouted to a different server if one fails.
- Uses **health checks** to monitor server status and availability.

### **2. Back-of-the-Envelope Calculation**

- **Users**: 1 billion users globally.
- **Content**: 10 PB of static content.
- **Edge Servers**: 1000 edge servers globally.
- **Requests**: 10 million requests per second during peak.

- **Data Storage**:
  - Each server caches a subset (1% of total content) â†’ 100 TB per server.
  
- **Network Bandwidth**:
  - Assuming average content size is 1MB, bandwidth requirement ~10TB/s during peak.

### **3. Database Design**

#### **Tables**:

1. **Content_Metadata**:
   - `content_id` (PK)
   - `origin_url`
   - `cache_control`
   - `last_updated`

2. **Edge_Servers**:
   - `server_id` (PK)
   - `location`
   - `status`

3. **Cache_Logs**:
   - `log_id` (PK)
   - `server_id` (FK)
   - `content_id` (FK)
   - `timestamp`
   - `cache_hit` (boolean)

#### **Database**:
- **Primary DB**: Relational database (PostgreSQL) for metadata and logs.
- **Distributed DB**: NoSQL DB (Cassandra or DynamoDB) for distributed cache information.

---

### **4. API Design**

#### **Endpoints**:

1. **Get Content**:
   - `GET /content/{content_id}`
   - Response: Cached content or a redirect to the origin server.

2. **Invalidate Cache**:
   - `POST /cache/invalidate`
   - Body: `content_id`, `server_id` (optional).
   - Response: Success message.

3. **Get Server Status**:
   - `GET /servers/{server_id}/status`
   - Response: Current status and health of the server.

4. **Update Content Metadata**:
   - `PUT /content/{content_id}`
   - Body: Updated metadata.
   - Response: Success message.

### **5. High-Level Architecture**

#### **1. Edge Servers**
- Cache content and serve it to users.
- Use caching algorithms to manage stored content.

#### **2. Origin Server**
- Acts as the primary source for content.
- Pushes updates to edge servers or responds to pull requests.

#### **3. Load Balancer**
- Distributes incoming requests among edge servers.
- Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

#### **4. DNS and Anycast Routing**
- DNS routing directs users to the closest edge server.
- Anycast routing ensures low-latency access by routing to the nearest server.

#### **5. Monitoring and Analytics**
- Monitors server health, cache performance, and request logs.
- Uses tools like AWS CloudWatch or Prometheus for real-time metrics.

#### **6. Replication and Synchronization**
- Ensures content is replicated across edge servers.
- Uses background synchronization for cache updates.

---

### **6. Scalability and Fault Tolerance**

- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling by adding more edge servers.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Regular health checks and failover mechanisms to reroute traffic in case of server failure.
