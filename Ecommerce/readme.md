- **Order History**: Users can view their previous orders, track current orders, and manage returns.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add, remove, and modify items in their shopping cart.

#### **User Account Database Design**
- **User Data**: Store information like name, email, shipping address, payment methods, order history, etc.
- **Authentication**: Use services like **AWS Cognito** for user authentication and management, which provides secure sign-up, sign-in, and account recovery.
- **Order History**: Track orders placed by users, including products, prices, shipping information, and order status.

### **4. Order Processing**

#### **Order Lifecycle**
1. **Order Creation**: A user selects products and proceeds to checkout.
2. **Order Confirmation**: The system verifies stock availability and reserves the products.
3. **Payment Processing**: The user proceeds to payment.
4. **Shipping and Delivery**: Once payment is confirmed, the order is processed and shipped.
5. **Order Tracking**: Users can track the status of their orders (e.g., shipped, in transit, delivered).

#### **Order Database Design**
- **Order Table/Collection**: Store order details, including:
  - Order ID
  - Product IDs (referencing products in the catalog)
  - User ID (referencing the user who placed the order)
  - Order Status (pending, shipped, delivered)
  - Payment Status (paid, pending)
  - Shipping Address

- **Payment Processing Integration**: Use a payment gateway like **Stripe**, **PayPal**, or **AWS Payment Services** for processing payments securely.

### **5. Inventory Management**

#### **Inventory Features**
- **Stock Levels**: Track product availability and stock levels.
- **Restocking**: Automatic or manual notifications when stock levels are low.
- **Supplier Integration**: Integration with suppliers for product restocking.

#### **Inventory Database Design**
- **Inventory Table/Collection**: Store product stock information, including:
  - Product ID
  - Quantity available
  - Warehouse location
  - Restocking thresholds

#### **Inventory Management System**
- **Real-time Updates**: Inventory data should be updated in real time when an order is placed or restocked.
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Notify sellers or warehouse managers when inventory levels are low.

---

### **6. Payment Processing**

#### **Payment Gateway Integration**
- Integrate with payment gateways like **Stripe**, **PayPal**, or **Square** to handle transactions securely.
  - The payment process includes capturing the user’s payment details (credit card, debit card, etc.), verifying the payment, and confirming the transaction.
  
#### **Payment Features**
- **Fraud Detection**: Use services like **AWS Fraud Detector** to prevent fraudulent transactions.
- **Transaction Logging**: Log every transaction for auditing purposes.
- **Refund Management**: Implement an easy process for users to request refunds if necessary.

---

### **7. Recommendation Engine**

#### **Product Recommendations**
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend products based on the behavior of users with similar interests (e.g., "Customers who bought this item also bought").
- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommend products based on the features of the products a user has shown interest in (e.g., similar categories, price range, etc.).
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Show products based on the user’s browsing and purchasing history.

#### **Recommendation Engine Design**
- **Data Collection**: Gather data from users’ interactions (e.g., clicks, purchases, product views).
- **Model Training**: Use machine learning models (e.g., matrix factorization, neural networks) to generate personalized recommendations.
- **Real-time Personalization**: The recommendation engine should update in real time as the user interacts with the platform.

#### **Recommendation Engine Scalability**
- Use **AWS SageMaker** to deploy machine learning models and provide real-time predictions for product recommendations.
- Store recommendation data in a high-performance database like **Amazon DynamoDB** to ensure fast retrieval.
